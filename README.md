Recent work has demonstrated that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (\texttt{ARC}). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the asymmetric latent reasoning of TRMs as both an implicit policy improvement algorithm and a form of classifier-free diffusion guidance. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18× and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24$\%$ accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.
